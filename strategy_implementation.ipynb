    "- If using **ROC Threshold**: select the lookback window `roc_n` and a percentage threshold. (e.g., `roc_n=10` and `roc_threshold=0.03` means go long if price has risen more than 3% over the last 10 days.)\n",
    "- If using **MA Crossover**: choose short (`fast_n`) and long (`slow_n`) moving average lengths. (A typical choice might be 20-day vs 50-day MAs, but you can experiment.)\n",
    "- If using **MACD**: you can use the standard periods (12, 26, 9) for fast EMA, slow EMA, and signal line, or other values if justified.\n",
